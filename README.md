# DSA Using Python

This repository contains **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** implemented in **Python**. It aims to help beginners and advanced learners master core concepts in DSA by providing clean and easy-to-understand code examples.

## 🚀 Features:
- Well-structured code for a variety of data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- Classic algorithms like Sorting, Searching, Recursion, and Dynamic Programming.
- Detailed explanations for each implementation.

## 📁 Directory Structure:
- **arrays/**: Contains array-related algorithms.
- **linked_lists/**: Contains singly and doubly linked list implementations.
- **trees/**: Includes Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and more.
- **graphs/**: Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
- **sorting/**: Popular sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- **searching/**: Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search).

## 🛠️ How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the folder of the algorithm or data structure you're interested in, and open the corresponding `.py` file.
3. Run the script in a Python environment to see it in action.
